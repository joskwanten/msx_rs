//! Audio output: cpal stream that mixes the MSX's two sound chips.
//!
//! Two chips contribute audio on a real MSX1:
//!
//! - The **PSG** (AY-3-8910) lives on the main board; the Z80 talks to it
//!   via ports 0xA0/0xA1. It's a 3-channel square-wave + noise + envelope
//!   chip. We use the `psg` crate (a Rust port of Peter Sovietov's Ayumi).
//!
//! - The **SCC** sits inside Konami cartridges; the game writes to its
//!   registers through bank-switched cartridge addresses. Five wavetable
//!   channels, simpler than the PSG. Implemented in `crate::scc`.
//!
//! Threading model on native is the standard audio one: each chip lives
//! behind an `Arc<Mutex<_>>`. The audio callback locks both, generates one
//! mixed sample per output frame, unlocks. Register writes from the
//! emulator (via the Bus / cartridge mapper) lock briefly too. Contention
//! is low — emulator writes are sparse, audio callback runs in short bursts.
//!
//! On WebAssembly there's no `cpal` — Web Audio integration is its own
//! project. We compile a stub that owns the chips but produces no sound,
//! so the rest of the emulator (which writes to PSG/SCC registers
//! unconditionally) keeps working.
